###Student Programs File (I)
**File Name:** StudentPrograms  
**Description:** This file details student participation in various programs for the current school year. There should be one record per student per program for the current school year.

If a student is participating in or received services from more than one program, there should be a record for each program.

####Element I04 - State Student ID (SSID)
